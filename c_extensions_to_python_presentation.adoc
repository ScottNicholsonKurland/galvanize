= C/C++ Extensions to Python

== Introduction

We have a few little projects here to show how to call C or C++ from Python.

* simplest: a bare-bones example of a C-extension to Python
* multiple_modules: you can define many modules in a package, and have many C files
* numpy_example: send numpy arrays back and forth between C and Python
* cpp_example: C++ also works

[WARNING]
They only work with Python 3.  It can be done for 2.7, it is just a little different.

[source, bash]
.each one should build, install, and pass tests if you go into its directory and type make

cd simplest
make
